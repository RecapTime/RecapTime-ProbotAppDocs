We don't let you fall into the messy weekends manhunt in finding and getting support because we're covered about that. You aksed how, but you're in the right place! Scroll down around this page on how to get support.

## Option 1: The Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is available whetever you go around GitLab and GitHub divided in two different repositories. The first one where the app source code lives are [here](https://gitlab.com/MadeBYThePibsTeam-DevLabs/RecapTime-Staff/RecapTime-ProbotApp/issues) and [there again](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/RecapTime-ProbotApp/issues). For [the documetation documentation](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/probot-docs.recaptime.tk), that is **currently in GitLab only**, but we have plans to have to on GitHub soon (but without the Continuous Integration feature there).
