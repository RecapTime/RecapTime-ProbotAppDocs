# Setting up the bot for your GitHub repo

In this tutorial, we'll start the set up the bot by installing the app to your GitHub account (or organization) on the basics then configure it later using the `recaptime-config.yml` file.

## Prerequisites

In installing an GitHub app to your personal account or to your organization, you need to have the following prerequisites in order to continue in this tutorial:

* an GitHub account ([You can set it up if you don't have it.](https://github.com/join) By creating an account, you must agree to [GitHub ToS](http://help.github.com/terms/) and [GitHub Privacy Policy](http://help.github.com/privacy/).)
* an GitHub repository (Make sure you have the right permissions to manage integrations to the repo you want to install. You can create your own later or in advance before the installation progress.)
* an GitHub organization (you can create your own later)
