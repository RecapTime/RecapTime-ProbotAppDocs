# Welcome to Recap Time Probot App Documentation site!

The whole documentation site is hosted on GitLab Pages using MKdocs to power the site and Cloudflare for CDN caching and DDoS mitigation, among other things.

While we code our Probot GitHub app, this documentaion and the codebase itself are currently and still **work in progress**, so in case you have inquiries, you can create an new ticket in our main app repo (in GitLab or GitHub) or in this repo (only on GitLab).

## Wrong number?

Don't worry! You can return to [the main repo](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevTeam/recaptime-probotapp) ([Using GitHub](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/RecapTime-ProbotApp)
or [Glitch instead](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/recaptime-probotapp)? We got you there.) and continue coding or start remixing the project.

## What's new?

> Nothing to see here. Come back soon, check the releases section in both GitLab and GitHub, or see `CHANGELOGS.md` file at root directory of the codebase.
